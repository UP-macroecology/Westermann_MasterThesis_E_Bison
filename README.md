This repository contains all scripts necessary for my master thesis "Modelling genetic connectivity among European Bison populations in the fragmented Central European landscape". I conducted the study using RangeShiftR.

The main script is "Bison_bonasus_genetic_connectivity.Rmd". In this script I create all the modules needed to build and run RangeShiftR models. 
  -The scripts "Euclidean_distance_MovementPaths.R" and "Translocation_sequence.R" do not need to be run again, as the output was directly transferred to the respective section in the main script. I have mentioned the usage of these scripts in the respective chunks of code in the comments.
  -Genetic output from the models was further processed in seperate scripts for each model I ran, respectively --> "Gen_analysis_sXX.R"
